\title{Simulate a data frame from a DAG}
\usage{
sim(dag, n)
}
\arguments{
\item{dag}{a lower triangular matrix representing a
DAG or a matrix that can be permutted into
such a matrix.}

\item{n}{the number of observations to generate.}
}
\value{
a data frame with one column for each
       variable in the DAG. The variables are
       generated from a multivariate normal 
       distribution with mean zero
       and variance matrix implied by the 
       coefficients of the DAG.
