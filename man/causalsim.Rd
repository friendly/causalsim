\title{causalsim: A package to explore linear causal DAGs}
\description{
The causalsim package uses a matrix containing the 
coefficients and standard deviations of the unique
independent components of a linear causal
DAG to generate the marginal covariance matrix and to 
calculate the value of cofficients of
linear models applied to a population generated by
the causal DAG.
