The `causalsim` package uses a matrix containing the coefficients and standard deviations of the unique
independent components of a linear causal DAG to generate the marginal covariance matrix and to 
calculate the value of coefficients of linear models applied to a population generated by
the causal DAG.


## Installation

You can install the development version of causalsim like so:

``` r
remotes::install.github("gmonette/causalsim)
```

## Example

This example creates a DAG consisting of a collection of paths among the following variables
in a causal analysis. The variables included here are:

* **x** the focal predictor, e.g., a treatment variable
* **y** the outcome
* **m** a mediator variable
* **i** an instrumental variable, i.e., a predictor of only **x**
* **c** a covariate, i.e., a predictor of **y** one might also want to take into account
* **zr** 
* **zc** a central confounder, providing a backdoor path from **x** through **zl**  to **y** through **zr**
* **zl**

The DAG to be studied here is:

In `causalsim` this DAG is to be setup as a square matrix, `mat`, whose rows and columns are
the 8 variables shown in the figure.
The entries are:

* `mat[i, j]` = coefficient on the path from variable `j` to `i`
* `mat[i, i]` = error variance associated with variable `i`


```{r example}
library(causalsim)

nams <- c('zc','zl','zr','c','x','y','m','i')
mat <- matrix(0, length(nams), length(nams))
rownames(mat) <- nams
colnames(mat) <- nams

# set up paths: each value is the regression coefficient on the path

# direct effect
mat['y','x'] <- 3

# indirect effect
mat['m','x'] <- 1
mat['y','m'] <- 1

# Instrumental variable 
mat['x','i'] <- 2

# 'Covariate'
mat['y','c'] <- 1

# confounding back-door path
mat['zl','zc'] <- 2 
mat['zr','zc'] <- 2
mat['x','zl'] <- 1
mat['y','zr'] <- 2

# independent error
diag(mat) <- 2

mat # not in lower diagonal form   
dag <- to_dag(mat) # can be permuted to lower-diagonal form
dag



```
